# PHP-MySQL-Designer-Site
Allows users to create an account in order to open a line of communication with the designer 

*****    **WIP**    *****

This site was made for my Web Database Development class

I used the idea of an interior designer site which contains all of the information a possible customer would need, and expanded on it by adding user account functionality and the use of a MySQL database to store user information as well as messages. That functionality was made possible using PHP

All CSS in the site was hand written and I came up with the site design

I envisioned the home page having several horizontal panes instead of just the one, but due to lack of actual designer content, I haven't added more to fill the page completely

Once a user makes an account and signs in, they can either change their password, change their account information, create a new message, or view messages that they've already sent to the designer

I want the message system to be able to:
  * Email the designer and the user the message the user sends
  * (DONE) Allow the user to decide if they want emailing to occur
  * (DONE) Store the message in the database
  * Be able to display the message to the user and designer on the site
  * (DONE) Allow the user to delete a message
  * Send the designer a deletion email notification if the user enabled emails

**This site was NOT developed for mobile devices**
